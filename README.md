# Guessing Game - Java

## Introduction
This is a simple command-line number guessing game written in Java. The program generates a random number between **1 and 10**, and the user has **three attempts** to guess it correctly. If the user guesses the number correctly within the allowed attempts, they win the game; otherwise, the correct number is revealed after three unsuccessful attempts.

## Features
- Random number generation between **1 and 10**.
- **Game menu** to start a new game or exit.
- **Input validation** to ensure users enter a valid numeric guess.
- **Error handling** to catch invalid input types (e.g., non-numeric values).
- Provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
- Limits the number of attempts to **three**.
